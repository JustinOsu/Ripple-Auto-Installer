###! all the information about installing and configuring ripple server
###! This guide is based on old ripple guides (https://github.com/osuripple/ripple/wiki), Other developer's Way and my personal experience.
###! Script to configure ripple stack
###! -- ABSTRACT --
###! We need to clone following repositories using `git` (git clone repoURL):
###! Old-frontend, avatar-server, peppy, lets
###!   - Old-Frontend (https://zxq.co/ripple/old-frontend) as implied deprecated frontend with ripple administration panel to manage ingame activities from a website which can be viewed at [ old.domain ].
###!   - avatar-server (https://github.com/Uniminin/avatar-server)  for managing all user's avatars in-game & in frontend.
###!   - pep.py (https://zxq.co/ripple/pep.py) for handling ingame login, chat, spectator and multiplayer. (osu bancho backend)
###!   - lets (https://zxq.co/ripple/lets) for handling online leaderboards, score submission, pp calculation, screenshots and osu!direct.
###! NOTE THAT If running pep.py & lets for the first time will create a config.ini file inside its folder which needs to be configured.
###!
###! Hanayo, rippleapi
###! We need to clone following repositories using `go` (go get -u repoURL | -u clones them with dependencies):
###!  - Hanayo (https://zxq.co/ripple/hanayo) for website. (frontend)
###!  - rippleapi (https://zxq.co/ripple/rippleapi) for defining interactions between multiple softwares i.e hanayo, lets, pep.py . 
###! NOTE THAT If running Hanayo & rippleapi for the first time will create hanayo.conf & api.conf respectively file inside its folder which needs to be configured.

###! Dependencies
###! - Mysql
###! - Redis
###! - Php-fpm
###! - Go
###! - python
###! - nginx
###! - Ripple code

###! THINGS TO AUTOMATE
###! Mysql Database
###! WARNING (SQL. MYSQL To be more specific.)
###!  - MySQL: If you cant maintain security in your own server you shouldnt run it. More info : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/security-guidelines.html

###! SETTING UP MYSQL.
###!  - Create a database with ?name and ?password and ?database_name from user's input.
###!  - import this sql file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uniminin/Ripple-Auto-Installer/master/Database%20files/ripple.sql in specified database_name from input.

###! Inputs To Receive and Process from User (ppl running the script)
###! TARGET-DIRECTORY: Get A Master directory path where all the repos will be cloned and configured. (build the repo with necessary dependencies needed to run them.)
###! fill MYSQL DatabaseName, Username & Password (specified in input) to fill up in config files. Repos Needed for config file configuration are:
###!  - peppy, lets -> config.ini. (config.ini is generated after they're run/build successfully)
###!  - hanayo, rippleapi -> hanyo.conf & api.conf respectively (they're generated after they're build successfully)


###! RUNNING THE CODE
###! If you're looking to run the code, you probably have better luck to referring to : https://github.com/osuripple/ripple/wiki/How-to-setup-ripple
